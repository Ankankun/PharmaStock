    <h1>About Pharma Stock</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
        Smart Inventory Management for Modern Pharmacies
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Pharma Stock</strong> is a web-based pharmacy inventory management
        system developed to address the real-world challenges faced by medical
        stores and pharmacies. The platform focuses on simplifying stock handling,
        minimizing medicine wastage, and ensuring safer dispensing practices
        through technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Many small and medium-sized pharmacies still rely on manual registers or
        basic spreadsheet systems to manage inventory. These methods often fail
        to track critical details such as batch numbers and expiry dates, leading
        to expired medicines, financial loss, and compliance risks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pharma Stock was created to bridge this gap by offering a simple, efficient,
        and expiry-aware digital solution tailored specifically for pharmacy
        operations.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes Pharma Stock Different</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expiry-Centric Design:</strong> Inventory is managed using FEFO (First Expired, First Out) logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Batch-Level Tracking:</strong> Each medicine batch is tracked individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-User Data Isolation:</strong> Each shop owner’s data remains private and secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Web-Based Access:</strong> No installation required, accessible from any device.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add and manage medicines with batch number and expiry date</li>
        <li>Real-time stock visibility and availability status</li>
        <li>Point-of-sale system with accurate stock deduction</li>
        <li>Customer sales history and transaction records</li>
        <li>Secure authentication and session-based access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <p>
        Pharma Stock is built using modern web technologies to ensure reliability,
        scalability, and maintainability.
    </p>

        <li>Frontend: EJS, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>

        <li>Architecture: MVC (Model–View–Controller)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Can Use Pharma Stock</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Future Vision</h2>

        management solution. Planned enhancements include medicine scanning using
        OCR technology, automated alerts for near-expiry stock, and integration
        with messaging services for customer notifications.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project has been developed as part of an academic curriculum with
        the objective of applying theoretical concepts to solve practical problems
        in the healthcare retail sector. It reflects a strong emphasis on
        real-world usability, data integrity, and system security.
